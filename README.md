### Assignment overview

<p align = "justify">Pipelines are common in most walks of life, digital circuits, software, transportaion, industries, sales.... pipelines are almost everywhere! Pipelines used for data analysis take inputs which go through a number of processing steps that are chained together in some way to produce the desired output. Pipelines therefore are sort of a chain of commands that can be run on one or more data sets. Vey helpful when we are going to have to rerun any analysis especially with multiple files.

"Just as we save R code in a script so we can replay analytical steps, we can also record how a series of scripts and commands work together to produce a set of analytical results. This is what we mean by automating data analysis or building an analytical pipeline." A Makefile describes a pipeline of shell commands and the interdependencies of the input and output files of those commands.</p> 

### Benefits of automating analytics pipelines using R and Make:

* Automation helps us reproduce previous results and recreate deleted results
* We can rerun a pipeline with updated software or on a different dataset.
* Make can resume a pipeline after a failed command without needing to start over
* Make can run independent jobs in parallel. 
* A Makefile describes a pipeline of shell commands and the interdependencies of the input and output files of those commands. 
* A Makefile can be easily displayed as a graphical flow chart of files and shell commands, and such a visualization is a pleasing and powerful way to interpret a pipeline oneself or to communicate a pipeline to a collaborator
