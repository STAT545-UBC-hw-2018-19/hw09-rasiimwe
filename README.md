make-activity
=============

The commit history of this repository reflects what a student might do as she works through [this activity](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/automation04_make-activity.html) from [STAT 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io). This fully developed example shows:

  * How to run an R script non-interactively
  * How to use `make`
    - to record which files are inputs vs. intermediates vs. outputs
    - to capture how scripts and commands convert inputs to outputs
    - to re-run parts of an analysis that are out-of-date
  * The intersection of R and `make`, i.e. how to
    - run snippets of R code
    - run an entire R script
    - render an R Markdown document (or R script)
  * The interface between RStudio and `make`
  * How to use `make` from the shell
  * How Git facilitates the process of building a pipeline
