### Assignment overview

Pipelines are common in most walks of life, digital circuits, software, transportaion, industries, sales.... pipelines are almost everywhere! Pipelines used for data analysis take inputs which go through a number of processing steps that are chained together in some way to produce the desired output. Pipelines therefore are sort of a chain of commands that can be run on one or more data sets. 

"Just as we save R code in a script so we can replay analytical steps, we can also record how a series of scripts and commands work together to produce a set of analytical results. This is what we mean by automating data analysis or building an analytical pipeline." A Makefile describes a pipeline of shell commands and the interdependencies of the input and output files of those commands.

### Benefits of using R and Make to build analytics pipelines:

* Make can resume a pipeline after a failed command without needing to start over
* Make can run independent jobs in parallel. 
* A Makefile describes a pipeline of shell commands and the interdependencies of the input and output files of those commands. 
* A Makefile can be easily displayed as a graphical flow chart of files and shell commands, and such a visualization is a pleasing and powerful way to interpret a pipeline oneself or to communicate a pipeline to a collaborator

#### Assignment Goals:

The goal of this activity is to create a pipeline that will

* obtain a large file of English words
* calculate a histogram of word lengths
* determine the most common word length
* generate a figure of this histogram
* render a R Markdown report in HTML and PDF
* .....
